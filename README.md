# Comparative Skeleton Analysis Using Python
Exploring the Human Skeleton, Mammals, and Birds Through Data

Welcome to this interactive data-science exploration of bones across species!
In this project, we uncover fascinating biological patterns—like why humans have 206 bones, why babies start with 305, and why a swan’s neck bends so gracefully.

# 📌 Project Overview

This repository analyzes skeletal datasets to answer evolutionary and anatomical questions:

How many bones are in the human body?

Is the claim “over half your bones are in your hands and feet” true?

How many bones do babies have?

Why do almost all mammals have exactly 7 neck vertebrae—even giraffes?

Which bird has the most neck bones? 

Using pandas and Python, we explore:

-adult-human-skeleton.csv

-mammal-neck-bones.csv

-bird-neck-bones.csv

This project blends biology + data science + psychological curiosity, encouraging the reader to think about how patterns in evolution shape our expectations.

# 🧠 Why This Project Matters

From a cognitive psychology perspective, humans love patterns.
When a pattern breaks—like sloths having 6 or 9 neck bones—it catches our attention and deepens learning.

This project uses data to challenge assumptions and strengthen scientific thinking—skills essential in research, engineering, and decision-making.
